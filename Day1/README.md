# Introduction - Day 1

Welcome to the #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge with the #TrainWithShubham Community! Today, we begin our journey into the world of DevOps. Here’s what you need to do:

1. **Fork this Repository:**
   - Go to the repository on GitHub and fork it to your own account. This will allow you to track your progress and contribute.

2. **Start with a DevOps Roadmap:**
   - Watch the introductory video on DevOps: [DevOps Roadmap](https://youtu.be/g_QHuGq3E2Y?si=fR9K56-JevZTfrBK)

3. **Write a LinkedIn Post or a Small Article:**
   - Share your understanding of DevOps based on the video and your research. Cover the following points:

     - **What is DevOps:**
       DevOps is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) that integrates people, processes, and technology to deliver applications and services more quickly and reliably
       
     - **What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure:**
       Automation: Using technology to perform repetitive tasks with minimal human effort, improving efficiency and accuracy (e.g., automated email replies).
     Scaling: Expanding or reducing resources to match demand, ensuring performance and cost-effectiveness (e.g., adding servers during high traffic).
     Infrastructure: The foundational systems—hardware, software, cloud, and networking—needed to support operations (e.g., data centers or cloud platforms).
       
     - **Why DevOps is Important:**
     Faster Delivery: DevOps practices streamline development and operations, enabling quicker releases and updates.
     Improved Collaboration: It bridges the gap between development and operations teams, fostering better communication and teamwork.
     Higher Quality: Continuous integration and testing ensure more reliable, bug-free software.
     Scalability: Automated infrastructure and processes help handle growth efficiently.
     Cost Efficiency: By automating repetitive tasks, DevOps reduces manual labor and operational costs.
    Better User Experience: Faster issue resolution and frequent updates improve end-user satisfaction.
